## What is TrashMe 3?

**TrashMe 3** is a Mac-native utility that tackles two chronic problems on macOS: apps that don‚Äôt fully remove themselves and storage that silently fills with caches, logs, and forgotten items. Unlike a simple ‚Äúsend to Trash,‚Äù TrashMe 3 finds the *entire footprint* of an app‚Äîits preference files, caches, containers, helper tools, launch agents, plug-ins, and saved states‚Äîso when you uninstall, you reclaim space and eliminate background processes that could keep running or recreate clutter.

At its core is a **smart uninstall engine**. When you choose an app to remove, TrashMe 3 scans common and developer-specific locations (Application Support, Containers, Group Containers, Caches, Preferences, LaunchAgents/Daemons, Logs, Saved Application State, Fonts/Plug-ins, etc.). It then presents a human-readable report so you can review every item before confirming. This approach protects power users who want control, while giving newcomers confidence that nothing important will be deleted accidentally.

TrashMe 3 also addresses the mess left by software removed long ago. The **Leftovers** module hunts for orphaned files tied to missing apps‚Äîgigabytes of caches, settings, and crash logs that normal tools overlook. You can filter by size, age, or location, preview items, and clear them in one pass. Paired with the **App Reset** feature (which wipes an app‚Äôs data without deleting the app itself), you can either start fresh or completely remove what you no longer need.

Beyond uninstalls, TrashMe 3 functions as a **precision cleaner**. The **Cleaning Dashboard** targets safe-to-delete caches and logs, Xcode/Developer cruft (DerivedData, device support, simulators), browser data, language files, and temporary downloads. A **Disk Overview** gives a visual map of storage usage to reveal large folders, ancient archives, duplicate or similar files, and installers you no longer need‚Äîperfect for freeing tens of gigabytes before a system update or large project.

Because safety matters, the app includes thoughtful **protection layers**. You can build safelists for apps, folders, and file types; require confirmations for risky paths; and view detailed change summaries before committing. When uninstalls touch running processes, TrashMe 3 proposes a clean quit. If Full Disk Access is required to reach sandboxed locations, the app guides you step-by-step so you retain full control.

TrashMe 3 blends into macOS rather than fighting it. The interface is **clean, keyboard-friendly, and dark-mode aware**; results update in real time; and scans are engineered to be fast on Apple Silicon while staying responsive on Intel machines. Whether you‚Äôre curating a minimal system for audio/video work, cleaning up after development tooling, or preparing a Mac for resale, the workflow is straightforward: *scan ‚Üí review ‚Üí reclaim*.

Real-world workflows benefit immediately. Designers and developers purge huge **Xcode** and **Adobe** caches between projects. Students and researchers clear **Downloads** sprawl and multi-GB ‚Äú.dmg/.zip‚Äù leftovers. IT admins reset misbehaving apps to factory state without touching licenses. Creators who batch-install plug-ins can remove failed experiments cleanly, avoiding plugin conflicts and launch errors.

Privacy and transparency are built in. TrashMe 3 runs locally, explains what it finds, and leaves the **final decision** to you. Reports can be exported for audits; actions are reversible until you empty the Trash; and nothing is deleted silently. With clear explanations attached to each module, you always know *what* is being removed, *why* it‚Äôs safe, and *how much* space you‚Äôll get back.

In short, TrashMe 3 is both **uninstaller and storage strategist**: it removes apps completely, exposes hidden clutter, and helps you regain control of disk space‚Äîwithout risking critical files or wasting time on manual hunts.
